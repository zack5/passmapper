# PassMapper

Demo: https://passmapper.netlify.app/

In 2023, I began making a concerted effort to collect a transit card from every city I visited. I enjoy the physical sensation of rifling through cards to find the one I want. PassMapper was designed to capture that feeling digitally.

If you would like to fork this project to track your own collection, fill out /data/data.json and upload images for the corresponding cards (format: [id].jpg) in /public/cards.
